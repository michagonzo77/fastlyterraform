It prompts users to specify the environment (dev, qa, or production) and the service name, intelligently filtering services based on the environment provided. Users then define the type of data they wish to query, such as 5xx errors, 4xx errors, request counts, cache hit ratio, etc, along with the desired duration. Fastly executes the Fastly stats command dynamically, ensuring accurate querying while handling time intervals appropriately. In case of errors or empty output, Fastly provides intelligent error handling, notifying the user and suggesting relevant metrics to assist in specifying valid queries.\n",
